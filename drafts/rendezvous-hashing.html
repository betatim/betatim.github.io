    <p>This post will introduce you to an algorithm called rendezvous hashing. It is
a great algorithm for load balancing requests without having to keep any state
in your load balancers.</p>
<p>Imagine you operate a very large warehouse. With many, many rows of  shelves.
To distribute arriving goods to all of the shelves in all of the rows you have
ten fork-lifts. When a pallet of bananas is delivered to
the warehouse one of the fork-lifts picks it up and puts it on a shelf in
the row for bananas. The same happens when a pallet of chocolate, washing machines
or hammers arrives.</p>
<p>Life is great. Each of the fork-lifts knows that bananas go in row five, hammers
in row 13 and washing machines in row 42. This means they can go about their
business without having to coordinate with all the other fork-lifts.</p>
<p>There is one problem though: every time a new kind of item is delivered all
the fork-lifts have to meet and briefly discuss where this new item should go.
This is not a big deal if you deal with the same set of items and rarely add
a new one.</p>
<p>However, in this day and age of consumerism new products are constantly being
invented and retired. This means your fork-lifts end up having to spend a lot
of time having to meet to coordinate.</p>
<p>Is there a way to reduce the amount of coordination needed? Yes there is.</p>
<p>A real applications of it are load-balancing and assigning keys to caches. Though
using it to coordinate fork-lifts sounds exciting as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>To solve the fork-lift problem we need
an algorithm that allows our fork-lift trucks (or frontends)
to agree which row (or backend server) to assign a pallet (or user) to. All without
having to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>One way of doing this would be to count the number of rows <code>n_rows</code> of shelves,
to take the serial number of the product on a pallet and compute <code>serial mod n_rows</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming the serial number is an integer then no matter what it is, this method
will give you a number that is less
than the total number of rows. So we can place a newly arrived pallet into the
row given by <code>serial mod n_rows</code>. All we have to do is tell every fork-lift to
use this formula and we are done. No matter which fork-lift picks up the pallet
they will all agree on which row it should be stored in.</p>
<p>For a practical example lets assume we have 100 rows in our warehouse. Assuming
the serial number for bananas is 20213, then we assign them to row <code>20213 mod 100 = 13</code>.
Hammers with serial number 74574 go into row <code>74574 mod 100 = 74</code>. And so on
for every product that we want to store.</p>
<p>To find an item again when it needs removing from the warehouse you can use
the same algorithm to find the row in which the item will be.</p>
<p>Life is great.</p>
<hr>
<p>A problem with this approach is that if the number of rows in the warehouse
changes, for example when one of them is full, our algorithm will not work anymore.</p>
<p>If we reduce the number of available rows from 100 to 99 all assignments change.
Bananas will move to row <code>20213 mod 99 = 17</code> and hammers  to row <code>74574 mod 99 = 27</code>.</p>
<p>To keep our system working we would have to pause adding items and rearrange
everything that is in the warehouse.</p>
