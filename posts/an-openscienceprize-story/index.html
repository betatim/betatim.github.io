    <p>This is the story of how I put my idea for an <a href="http://openscienceprize.org">openscienceprize</a>
entry on the internet, nearly gave up on it, and then met a ton of
incredible people. It all ended with: <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize">everpub</a> - reusable research,
21st century style.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize">Everpub</a> is a prototype to make reproducibility a first-class citizen
in research by enabling the publication of dynamic and interactive
scientific narratives that can be verified, altered, reused, and cited
from a web browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/issues">Join the lively discussion</a> on how to pull that off.</p>
<h2>Say what?</h2>
<p>I want to build a web app that allows you to browse scientific publications,
edit them, re-run them, and fork them. Imagine my <a href="http://betatim.github.io/posts/really-interactive-posts/">interactive blog posts</a>
meets <a href="http://everware.xyz">everware</a>/<a href="http://mybinder.org">mybinder</a> meets the <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>.</p>
<p><img width="500" alt="A UI Mock Up for Everpub" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1448859/13301888/7217ff8a-db47-11e5-9c5a-51da4527821d.gif" title="A UI Mock Up for Everpub"></p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>It all <a href="https://github.com/betatim/openscienceprize/blob/ec454063a94ce5533191e50c7fd6b96fe9d6f09e/README.md">started</a> fairly harmlessly at the end of January. I put the
core of the idea on GitHub. One day later <a href="https://about.me/daniel.mietchen">Daniel Mietchen</a> posted an
issue about using a different license. I got in touch with a few
people, exchanged ideas, discussed the way forward. Not much happened,
there was not much traction. People were not joining me.</p>
<p>There is a lot of discussion and advice on the subject of putting your
grant proposals, science ideas, etc out on the internet for everyone
to read before you even submitted them or did any work on them. Mostly
people worry about it being stolen.</p>
<p>Far from everyone stealing my idea, the main action taken by others
was to ignore it. Damn it!</p>
<h2>On hold</h2>
<p>About ten days prior to the deadline I decided to put writing the
proposal on hold in favour of working on it. You see, in order to
be eligible for the prize you need a team with participants from the
US and outside the US. I was lacking a US collaborator.</p>
<p>I modified the <code>README</code> accordingly: This thing is <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/commit/e0b7af59d63d3672fc527e14a7ea08a479d5cbb2">on hold</a> until I
find a US collaborator.</p>
<h2>The breakthrough</h2>
<p>Suddenly I had a <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/pull/19">PR</a> from <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">Titus</a> wanting to join. I am still not
quite sure how I pulled that off. Maybe it was obnoxiously posting
comments on his blog about <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog//2016-mybinder.html">next gen scientific publishing</a>, or
letting him know I wanted to take part in this <a href="https://twitter.com/betatim/status/700696885141577729">openscienceprize speed
dating</a>. Either way, we now were a team!</p>
<h2>The end</h2>
<p>In the end a huge number of people contributed to the final proposal.
I think once one outsider joins (who happens to be super well
connected) it becomes much easier for others to sign on. The most
surprising thing for me was that people I had contacted earlier and
who were only mildly interested suddenly did join and contributed!</p>
<p>There was a lot of editing, discussing, to-and-fro'ing, and tons of
ideation, as well as some <a href="https://twitter.com/betatim/status/702539748716445696">grant-y language</a>. We could not settle all
discussions in time for the deadline, which shows you how difficult it
is to get this right.</p>
<p>The proposal we got in the end was much better than what we started
with. Several organisations and publishers showed their interest. The
proposal itself has received nearly 500 unique visits, and has more
stars then any other GitHub repo I have ever created. This is not
meant as a <code>#humblebrag</code>, I am still amazed that this happened. It
shows you the power of the internet.</p>
<p>For what that is worth, I will book this as a success.</p>
<h2>Openness first</h2>
<p>This proposal would not have happened if I had not put it out there
for all the research parasites to steal.</p>
<p>Based on my N=1 dataset, I would recommend that everyone do this. You
can get a lot done and meet interesting people this way. Ideas are so
cheap these days, that it is hardly worth protecting them. The
expensive part is executing on these ideas. You can do that in the
open as well because it is so costly. It seems like the worst that
could happen is you gain some superstar collaborators.</p>
<p>In a similar vein academics spend a lot of time discussing author
lists. What is the minimum contribution to be listed? Should we allow
anyone to join? How do we order them? My feeling is this time could be
better spent getting stuff done. History will not remember those who
wrote a <a href="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html">vague-but-exciting</a>
proposal but those who execute on it and remove the vague part to make
it exciting.</p>
<p>To quote an anonymous friend in when asked if they wanted to add their
name to the proposal: "Nah, thanks. I like the idea but I won't
pretend I'll give you serious help. And I can still join later since
it is open source :)"</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize">Everpub</a> aims to disrupt scientific publishing, in a good way. Let's
see how much of that big talk we can actually deliver. <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize">Everpub</a> will
be a open-source project so expect me to visit you to persuade you to
join for some actual work.</p>
<p>In the mean time, enjoy this science picture:</p>
