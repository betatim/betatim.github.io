            </header>
            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>This is the story about how I put my idea for an <a href="http://openscienceprize.org">openscienceprize</a>
entry on the internet, nearly gave up on it, and then met a ton of
incredible people. It all ended with: <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize">everpub</a> - reusable research,
21st century style.</p>
<p>Everpub is a prototype to make reproducibility a first-class citizen
in research by enabling the publication of dynamic and interactive
scientific narratives that can be verified, altered, reused, and cited
from a web browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/issues">Join the lively discussion</a> on how to pull that off.</p>
<h2>Say what?</h2>
<p>I want to build a web app that allows you to browse scientific publications,
edit them, re-run them, and fork them. Imagine my <a href="http://betatim.github.io/posts/really-interactive-posts/">interactive blog posts</a>
meets <a href="http://everware.xyz">everware</a> or <a href="http://mybinder.org">mybinder</a>.</p>
<p><img width="500" alt="A UI Mock Up for Everpub" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1448859/13301888/7217ff8a-db47-11e5-9c5a-51da4527821d.gif" title="A UI Mock Up for Everpub"></p>
<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>It all <a href="https://github.com/betatim/openscienceprize/blob/ec454063a94ce5533191e50c7fd6b96fe9d6f09e/README.md">started</a> fairly harmlessly at the end of January. I put the
core of my idea on github. One day later <a href="https://about.me/daniel.mietchen">Daniel Mietchen</a> posted an
issue about using a different license. I got in touch with a few
people, exchanged ideas, discussed the way forward. However there was
not much traction. </p>
<p>There is a lot of discussion and advice on the subject of putting your
grant proposals, science ideas, etc out on the internet for everyone
to read before you even submitted them or did any work on them. Mostly
people worry about it being stolen. Far from everyone stealing my
idea, I think the main action taken by others was to ignore it. Damn
it!</p>
<h2>On hold</h2>
<p>About ten days prior to the deadline I decided to put writing the
proposal on hold in favour of working on it. You see, in order to
be eligible for the prize you need a team with participants from the
US and outside the US. I was lacking a US collaborator.</p>
<p>I modified the <code>README</code> accordingly: This thing is <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/commit/e0b7af59d63d3672fc527e14a7ea08a479d5cbb2">on hold</a> until I
find a US collaborator.</p>
<h2>The breakthrough</h2>
<p>Suddenly I had a <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize/pull/19">PR</a> from <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/">Titus</a> wanting to join. I am still not
quite sure how I pulled that off. Maybe it was obnoxiously posting
comments on his blog about <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog//2016-mybinder.html">next gen scientific publishing</a>, or
letting him know I wanted to take part in this <a href="https://twitter.com/betatim/status/700696885141577729">openscienceprize speed
dating</a>. Either way, we now were a team!</p>
<h2>The end</h2>
<p>In the end a huge number of people contributed to the final proposal.
I think once one outsider joins (who happens to be super well
connected) it becomes much easier for others to sign on. The most
surprising was that people I had contacted earlier and who were only
mildly interested suddenly did join and contributed!</p>
<p>There was a lot of editing, discussing, to-and-fro'ing, and tons of
ideation, as well as some <a href="https://twitter.com/betatim/status/702539748716445696">grant-y language</a>. Some discussions we
could not settle in time for the deadline, which jsut shows how
difficult it is to get this right.</p>
<p>The proposal we got in the end was much better than what we started
with. Several organisations and publishers showed their interest. The
proposal itself has received nearly 500 unique visits, and has more
stars then any other github repo I have created. For what that is
worth, I will book it under success.</p>
<h2>Openness first</h2>
<p>This proposal would not have happened if I had not put it out there
for all the research parasites to steal.</p>
<p>Based on my N=1 dataset, I would recommend that everyone do this. You
can get a lot done and meet interesting people this way. Ideas are so
cheap these days, that it is hardly worth protecting them. The
expensive part is executing on these ideas. You can do that in the
open as well because it is so costly. It seems like the worst that
could happen is you gain some superstar collaborators.</p>
<p>In a similar vein academics spend a lot of time discussing author
lists. What is the minimum contribution to be listed? Should we allow
anyone to join? How do we order them? My feeling is this time could be
better spent getting stuff done. History will not remember those who
wrote a <a href="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html">vague-but-exciting</a> but
those who execute on it and remove the vague part to make it exciting.</p>
<p>To quote an anonymous friend in reply to adding their name to the
proposal: "Nah, thanks. I like the idea but I won't pretend I'll give
you serious help. And I can still join later since it is open source
:)"</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Everpub aims to disrupt scientific publishing, in a good way. Let's see
how much of that big talk we can actually deliver. <a href="https://github.com/everpub/openscienceprize">Everpub</a> will be
a open-source project so expect me to be trying to persuade you to
join to do some actual work.</p>
<p>In the mean time, enjoy this science picture:</p>
