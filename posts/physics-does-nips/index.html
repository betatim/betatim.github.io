            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>Last week I attended the second half of <a href="//nips.cc">NIPS 2015</a>. It was
great! I am an experimental particle physicist, not a professional
machine-learning guy. This was the first time I went to NIPS and it
was very different from big conferences I have experienced in particle
physics.</p>
<p>This post is a summary of my impressions, and a reading list of sorts.</p>
<p><img alt="A physicist's view of NIPS" src="/images/inception-deep-learning.jpeg" title="A physicist's view of NIPS" style="width: 400px;">
<figcaption><em>A physicist's view of NIPS. Image Credit: Googler Mike Tyka’s </em><a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB" rel="nofollow">Inceptionism Library</a></figcaption></p>
<h2>Conference format</h2>
<p>NIPS takes place from Monday to Saturday. The first day is tutorials,
and the last two are dedicated to workshops. On all other days the
conference operates in single track mode. There are a few longer talks
each day but the majority of the time is dedicated to "spotlight"
talks. These are three minute long talks about a selected few of the
day's posters. Then there are the epic poster sessions each day.</p>
<p>The workshops are organised by "outsiders" (not conference
organisers), and there are a lot of them in parallel.</p>
<p>Overall about 3700 people attended the conference.</p>
<h2>Business</h2>
<p>I was not just a tourist in machine-learning wonderland, I had to do
some work as well. I gave an invited talk at the <a href="//yandexdataschool.github.io/aleph2015/">ALEPH
workshop</a> on Friday. In the
same workshop <a href="https://twitter.com/glouppe">Gilles</a> talked about some
work we did together: <a href="https://github.com/glouppe/talk-aleph-workshop2015">Pitfalls of evaluating a classifier's
performance in high energy physics
applications</a>.</p>
<p>More physicists should go and give talks at NIPS. You can learn a lot,
make connections to people you would not otherwise meet, and have your
mind blown by the craze that is deep learning.</p>
<p>Particle physics (HEP) has hard and interesting problems to solve. Attracting
the skills of the machine learning community would be great. HEP would make
progress faster, and it would spark interesting research for the NIPS
community. Right now the barrier to entry to HEP is extremely high though.
We should work on fixing that.</p>
<h2>Posters, posters, posters</h2>
<p>The first surprise was that how many poster sessions there are at NIPS
and how well attended they are.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4 nights in a row, 100 posters per night, from 7pm till 11pm, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nips2015?src=hash">#nips2015</a> poster session. <a href="https://t.co/NOxPzzwdhu">https://t.co/NOxPzzwdhu</a> <a href="https://t.co/VPS7abv3Yy">pic.twitter.com/VPS7abv3Yy</a></p>&mdash; Tim Head (@betatim) <a href="https://twitter.com/betatim/status/674786498076655616">December 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Given the conference format, it makes sense, but it was still surprising
for me. At most physics conferences the focus is on short talks in parallel
sessions.</p>
<p>I enjoyed having the opportunity to ask really dumb questions to the
poster presenters without having to reveal my ignorance to a room full
of experts. I tried to prepare for the two poster sessions I was in town
for by reading the abstracts for that session. It helped, but I would have
had to do a lot mroe studying for it to be really useful. Just walking around
and reading the introduction to each poster turned out to be quite a good
strategy. I usually ran out of posters before the session was over.</p>
<h2>Free stuff</h2>
<p>The other big differnce was how many people from industry attended the
conference. Basically everywhere you saw someone wearing something branded
by Google DeepMind or FAIR.</p>
<p>There were also a lot of parties or dinners organised by companies. This
does not happen at physics conferences. I am sure if you wanted to you
could have eaten and drunk for free all week. Ideal for grad students?!?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Below follows a collection of things I found interesting or want to
investigate further. It is half todo list, and half recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>There are a lot of them. Interesting thoughts about how to <a href="http://ciml.chalearn.org/">organise coopetitions if the aim is to produce and share new knowledge</a>. The <a href="http://yandexdataschool.github.io/aleph2015/">ALPEH Workshop</a>, not just because I gave a talk there ... <a href="http://bayesopt.com/">Bayesian optimisation</a>, we optimise everything! <a href="http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/">Reasoning, attention, memory</a>, did not attend but looking forward to videos. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tlworkshop2015/">Transfer learning</a>, what if training and testing densities are not the same (also known as: my simulator is not perfect!!).</p>
<h2>Reading list</h2>
<p>This is a unordered list of posters, talks or otherwise interesting things
that ended up on my reading list. <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy">karpathy</a>'s <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/nips2015/">machine-learning powered overview of the NIPS papers</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It was a great experience! I saw a great deal of new things, and I now have
reading material for the next few months. Let's see if I ever get to the end.
If you get a chance to go to NIPS, take it. NIPS will be in Barcelona in 2016.</p>
