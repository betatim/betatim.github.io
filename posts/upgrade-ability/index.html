    <p>People who create software obsess about versioning. What version am I using?
What is the latest version? Are these two versions compatible? Can I upgrade
from this version to the latest one? Is SemVer the best versioning system?</p>
<p>This post will explore the idea that of software without versions.
This post will tell you why it is a bad thing if you (have to) care about
software versions and try to convince you that the only thing that matters is
"upgrade-ability".</p>
<p>"Upgrade-ability" is a measure that combines how easy it is to upgrade and how
risky an upgrade is. The lower both of those are, the higher the
"upgrade-ability".</p>
<h2>User don't care about versioning</h2>
<p>As a user of software one of the last things you care about is which version
you are running. Don't believe me?</p>
<p>As quick as you can: what version of Chrome are you
using? - Chances are you have no idea and finding out would take you a moment.
This is great. It means that the last time you cared which version of Chrome
you are using is a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>Maybe you are not the graphical user interface kind of person. Fair enough.
Which version of curl are you running? - You had to look that up, didn't you?</p>
<p>Everyone is using Slack all day, every day. Never unplugged, always ready to
respond to chats. Surely for such an important and frequently used tool you
know the version you are using. No?</p>
<p>The point is that you do not know and neither should you. You have probably
never had to care about which version you were using, whether it was compatible
with some other software, or if you can (or need to) upgrade it.</p>
<p>This is a good thing. It means you are using each of these tools as a
tool to perform a task you actually care about. Like finding cute cat pictures.</p>
<p>The only software I know the version of is software that someone did not work
or frequently breaks when I change versions.</p>
<p>Knowing the version of software you use is like knowing the number of your car
dealer of by heart. It means it breaks too often.</p>
<h2>Programmers shouldn't care about versioning</h2>
<p>The creators of software spend an inordinate amount of time dealing
with software versions and versioning. But they shouldn't have to.</p>
<p>What versioning scheme should our software use? Endless
and heated discussions can be triggered by bringing up this question. There
are many schemes to choose from each with some perceived benefits and drawbacks.
I don't know of a software project where the choice of versioning scheme was
in the top five factors that determined success or failure. If you do, let me
know!</p>
<p>How often should we create a new release and what should be part of it?
Another set of questions that can trigger very long deliberation phases. After
which, no software has been released and put in the hands of users.</p>
<p>Another job that takes a lot of effort is backporting changes to earlier version.
Imagine after releasing v2.3 and v3.0 a important bug is discovered that exists
in both versions. You now need to backport the fix to v2.3 and make a new release
v2.3.1. You also have to release v3.0.1</p>
<p>This brings us to the next big discussion: How many different versions do we
support and for how long? There is no easy answer and so it will take a lot of
effort to find the right one for your project.</p>
<p>Because backporting changes and supporting multiple versions is such hard work
most projects choose to only support one version: the current version. This is
a fine choice. However you now need to work on making it easy to upgrade.</p>
<p>A software "without versions" (like your browser) is a great solution to all
these difficulties. Without versions you don't need to discuss versioning schemes.
Without versioning you can release as often as you want. You only need to
maintain one version.</p>
<p>Otherwise you will become known as the software that is "pretty unstable" and</p>
<p>But, breaking changes! How should we do those?</p>
<h2>Take away</h2>
<p>As someone who creates software with the goal of having lots of people use it:
try to setup things so your users do not have to care about which version
they are using. Because they'd rather not care</p>
<p>This is hard work. Good luck!</p>
